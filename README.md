Mr. Yusuke Endoh ([https://github.com/mame](https://github.com/mame))'s entry to the 2012 IOCCC competition was an [incredible, mesmerizing fluid dynamics simulation in an 80x24 terminal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMYfkOtYYlg).

I'm trying to deobfuscate his obfuscated code, and hopefully learn something about obfuscated C code in the process! Fortunately, Mr. Endoh has provided some information on how it works. [http://www.ioccc.org/2012/endoh1/hint.html](http://www.ioccc.org/2012/endoh1/hint.html)
